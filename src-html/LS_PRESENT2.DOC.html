GEOS Loadstar Presenter Rev. 2
by: Bo Zimmerman

Introduction:
    	This is for all you geoJunkies out there with the same mission as I: to find point and click solutions for all the things we would normally do in "C64" mode. Enjoying our issues of Loadstar should be no exception.

    GEOS Loadstar Presenter is intended to be a GEOS replacement (well, a partial replacement) of the normal Presenter you load to read, run, and copy from your issues of Loadstar.  It features full text browsing support, ability to use 3.5" or 5.25" formats, program execution right from the menus (for the non-GEOS programs), desk accessory access, and program copy support.  All of the familiar Loadstar features and files are arranged as you find them in the normal Presenter with one exception-- they are all point and clickable with your GEOS supported input device.

How to use the program
    When you receive your issue of Loadstar in the mail, your first step will be to load GEOS and launch the GEOS Loadstar Presenter by double clicking on its icon.  The Presenter will then give you a dialog box which looks suspiciously like a file selector.  It has the name of the current disk in a box on the top, below which is a list of the first few files on the disk.  On the right are a series of buttons: OK, Drive, Disk, and Quit.

    From here, you will have to insert disk #1 of your Loadstar issue into any of your GEOS supported disk drives.  If the drive containing the issue is the same as the drive from which you launched the GEOS Presenter, then you will want to click on the Disk icon which notifies the program of a disk change.  If the Loadstar issue disk is on another drive, you will want to click on the Drive icon.  The Drive icon will cycle through up to three of your GEOS drives and show the contents of their disks.  When you have selected the disk containing your issue of Loadstar, click on the Open button to begin reading the disk.  If you have the wrong disk, or the wrong side of a 5.25" disk in the drive, an error message "Loadstar files not found" will appear.  The Quit button will take you back to the deskTop.

    After opening your issue, the familiar Loadstar logo and features will appear on your screen along with a menu along the top of the screen.  The features along the left side of the screen are in fact buttons, and may be clicked on to reveal the files in that section on a separate menu on the right side of your screen.  Clicking on a file name in this new menu will bring up the familiar box with the "Read it!, "Run it!", and "Copy it!" options.  Clicking on one of these options will initiate it.  If you wish to exit from one of these submenus without making a selection, you have simply to move your pointer outside of the menu area to go back to a previous menu.

    If you select a "Read It!" option, you will be presented with a large light grey reading window.  Those of you using the 5.25" format of Loadstar may be prompted to insert a different Loadstar disk, which you should then do.  In the reading window, you may scroll both up and down within the text by pushing your pointer up against the top and bottom of the reading window respectively. Text may not appear quite as well formatted in the reading window as it does in the normal Presenter, but this is due to fact that the GEOS BSW font is of variable size, while the 40 column font in normal "C64" mode is fixed size.   Still, you should find reading easy and smooth in the GEOS presenter. To exit from the reading window, you need only click once within the window.  This will bring up your exit selections window.  Within this window are three options.  Choosing "Continue" will take you back to the reading screen and "Done" will bring you back to the "Read It!" window.  Selecting "Print" will begin dumping the text file to your printer.  For this option to work, your printer driver must have been present on the same disk from which you launched the Presenter application.

    If you choose a "Run It!" option, the program will initiate the loading of the program, drop out of GEOS, and pass control to the C64's normal mode of operation.  Of course, when you wish to exit from the program you run, it will attempt to bring you back to the regular Presenter instead of the GEOS Presenter.  You can thwart this by hitting the RESTORE key to re-boot GEOS and then re-launching the GEOS Presenter.  This may not work for all programs run from Loadstar, as it requires that the program you run not mess with the GEOS re-boot code that GEOS leaves behind in memory.  It is also feasible that some programs may not run correctly from the GEOS Presenter for one reason or another (though I havn't found one that wouldn't run yet), but these are minor concerns for the point-and-click benefits (at least I think so :).

    The "Copy It!" option will only support drive-to-drive copies, which means you should have more than one drive active in GEOS to use this option.  You will first be given a selection box with an A, B, and C button for each drive, along with the name of the disk in that drive, or "No Device" if that drive was not found by the program.  Select the destination disk for your copy by clicking on the appropriate disk's drive button.  The Presenter will then begin to copy the files from the Loadstar disk to the destination disk.  Note that the GEOS Presenter can not copy GEOS "VLIR" files, but then, neither can the regular presenter, and it is easy enough to do from the deskTop.

    On the top of the screen is a standard GEOS menu with two sections.  Under the "geos" section, you will find the standard "program info" option, along with a list of the desk accessories which were found on the disk from which you launched the presenter.  Selecting one of the desk accessories will execute them, though you may be prompted to re-insert the disk from which you launched the presenter if you have removed it.

    The other section on the top menu is "issue".  Under here are two selections. "next" will bring you back to the Loadstar disk selection box you found when you booted the Presenter, so that you may view another issue.  "quit" will take you straight back to the deskTop.

   Revision Notes:

    This is actually a very mild revision as far as functionality is concerned, but included a lot of code rewriting to reflect some changes in convention over at LoadStar.  The "Copy" function will now use the "files on disk X" files to build a file copy list instead of using the directory dividers that apparently aren't present on some "pass around" copies of the disk magazine.  

   Changes in the text packing routines have been implemented to reflect the new scheme.  Hopefully it is up to date now.

    Printer options have been added, and to lend further support to single drive users, the printer driver is actually buffered upon boot up so that the user need not swap disks when he or she wishes to print.
